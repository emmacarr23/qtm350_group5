    "text": "It is well-known that there is wide discrepancy in the economic standing of the various regions across our globe. Numerous factors contribute to these differences, such as technological innovation and globalization on the global-scale, as well as more country-specific characteristics like economic stability and domestic policies (e.g., fiscal policies, regulation of labor and product markets) (source). While the combination of these factors explains much of the variance observed in the real-world, less is known of the relative importance of individuals factors in explaining the total variability observed in global economic differences. And that is what we would like to explore.\nIn our research, we aim to identify the economic indicators that play the most significant roles in explaining variation seen in global regions’ economic standings, which we detemined by comparing each region’s GDP per capita. Specifically, we will be examining the highest-performing regions, North America and Europe & Central Asia, and the lowest-performing regions, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. We determined regional rankings through preliminary analysis (Figure 1). By examining these highly contrasting cases, we hope to pinpoint the most influential drivers of GDP per capita within and across these groups, regional economic disparity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1. Regional GDP per capita\n\n\n\nOur analysis examines the relationships between GDP per capita and three core indicators: adjusted income growth, employment to GDP ratio, and tax revenue to GDP ratio. Using linear regression models, we identify the magnitude and direction of these associations, as well as determine each indicator’s signficance in predicting each region’s GDP per capita."

    "text": "Results and Dicussion\nWe examined the association between seelected economic indicators and GDP per capita, stratified by region (Figure 2). In higher performing regions (North America and Europe & Central Asia), the strongest association was seen across GDP and emoployment ratio. On the contrary, association was weakest when comparing ajusted income growth, with little variation in the growth rate across varying levels of GDP.\nExamining the lowest performing regions (Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia), the strongest association was seen between tax revenue and GDP per capita. Both adjusted income growth and employment had weaker associations, with wide variability across points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 1. Association between economic indicators and GDP per capita, stratified by regional performance\n\n\n\nTo further quantify these relationships, we conducted a linear regression analysis using the following model:\nGDP_per_capita = adjusted income growth + employment ratio + tax revenue\nIn the higher performing regions, income growth had a negative impact, with an increase in adjusted income growth was associated with a $814.83 decrease in GDP per capita. Employment ratio and tax revenue had a positive association, with a one unit increase leading to a $1160.32 and $859.32 increase in GDP per capita, respecitvely. All indicators were significant, with p-values less than 0.01 (?@fig-regression_high).\nExamining the lower performing regions, our model focused on just the impact of tax revenue, as income growth and employment ratio were insignificant predictors at significance level = 0.05. Tax revenue demonstrated a positive impact on GDP per capita, with a one unit increase leading to $323.41 increase in GDP per capita. Tax revenue was the only significant indicator for these regions at significance level = 0.05, further highlighting the weaker associations observed amongst employment and income growth in the graphs(?@fig-regression_low).\nInterestly enough, the model for lower-performing regions better explained the variability seen in GDP when compared to the higher-performing region, as seen by the higher adjusted R-squared of 0.33 (compared to that of higher regions = 0.214)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, it is clear there are key differences in the factors that drive GDP per capita across higher- and lower-performing regions. In higher-performing regions, employment and tax review demonstrated a strong, positve association on GDP per capita. Adjusted income growth, contrarily, had a negative impact on GDP per capita. All three indicators were statistically significant in predicting GDP per capita in this group, suggesting they collectively contribute to these North America’s and Europe & Central Asia’s economic standing.\nFor lower-performing regions, tax revenue was the only indicator that was significant in predicting GDP growth, while adjusted income growth and employment ratio demonstrated weaker and statistically insignificant assionations.\nOur findings highlight the complexity of regional economic disparities and the variation in driving factors depending on the region of focus. For higher-performing regions, policies focused on employment rates and tax revenue may prove to be more effective, while lower-performing regions may see greater benefit by focusing their efforts on tax policy. Future research could explore additional factors that may be significant drivers in each of these regions to better improve our understanding of the key influences. Additional regions could also be included in future analysis, which may capture differences that we did observe in the highest and lowest-performing regions."

    "text": "It is well-known that there is wide discrepancy in the economic standing of the various regions across our globe. Numerous factors contribute to these differences, such as technological innovation and globalization on the global-scale, as well as more country-specific characteristics like economic stability and domestic policies (e.g., fiscal policies, regulation of labor and product markets) (source). While the combination of these factors explains much of the variance observed in the real-world, less is known of the relative importance of individuals factors in explaining the total variability observed in global economic differences. And that is what we would like to explore.\nIn our research, we aim to identify the economic indicators that play the most significant roles in explaining variation seen in global regions’ economic standings, which we detemined by comparing each region’s GDP per capita. Specifically, we will be examining the highest-performing regions, North America and Europe & Central Asia, and the lowest-performing regions, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. We determined regional rankings through preliminary analysis (Figure 1). By examining these highly contrasting cases, we hope to pinpoint the most influential drivers of GDP per capita within and across these groups, regional economic disparity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1. Regional GDP per capita\n\n\n\nOur analysis examines the relationships between GDP per capita and three core indicators: adjusted income growth, employment to GDP ratio, and tax revenue to GDP ratio. Using linear regression models, we identify the magnitude and direction of these associations, as well as determine each indicator’s signficance in predicting each region’s GDP per capita."

    "text": "We examined the association between seelected economic indicators and GDP per capita, stratified by region (Figure 1). In higher performing regions (North America and Europe & Central Asia), the strongest association was seen across GDP and emoployment ratio. On the contrary, association was weakest when comparing ajusted income growth, with little variation in the growth rate across varying levels of GDP.\nExamining the lowest performing regions (Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia), the strongest association was seen between tax revenue and GDP per capita. Both adjusted income growth and employment had weaker associations, with wide variability across points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1. Association between economic indicators and GDP per capita, stratified by regional performance\n\n\n\nTo further quantify these relationships, we conducted a linear regression analysis using the following model:\nGDP_per_capita = adjusted income growth + employment ratio + tax revenue\nIn the higher performing regions, income growth had a negative impact, with an increase in adjusted income growth was associated with a $814.83 decrease in GDP per capita. Employment ratio and tax revenue had a positive association, with a one unit increase leading to a $1160.32 and $859.32 increase in GDP per capita, respecitvely. All indicators were significant, with p-values less than 0.01 (?@fig-regression_high).\nExamining the lower performing regions, our model focused on just the impact of tax revenue, as income growth and employment ratio were insignificant predictors at significance level = 0.05. Tax revenue demonstrated a positive impact on GDP per capita, with a one unit increase leading to $323.41 increase in GDP per capita. Tax revenue was the only significant indicator for these regions at significance level = 0.05, further highlighting the weaker associations observed amongst employment and income growth in the graphs(?@fig-regression_low).\nInterestly enough, the model for lower-performing regions better explained the variability seen in GDP when compared to the higher-performing region, as seen by the higher adjusted R-squared of 0.33 (compared to that of higher regions = 0.214)."
