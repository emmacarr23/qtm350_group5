For higher-performing regions, policies focused on employment rates and tax revenue may prove to be more effective, while lower-performing regions may see greater benefit by focusing their efforts on tax policy. Future research could explore additional factors that may be significant drivers in each of these regions to better improve our understanding of the key influences.
