We examined the association between seelected economic indicators and GDP per capita, stratified by region (@fig-associations). In higher performing regions (North America and Europe & Central Asia), the strongest association was seen across GDP and emoployment ratio. On the contrary, association was weakest when comparing ajusted income growth, with little variation in the growth rate across varying levels of GDP. 

Examining the lowest performing regions (Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia), the strongest association was seen between tax revenue and GDP per capita. Both adjusted income growth and employment had weaker associations, with wide variability across points.

To further quantify these relationships, we conducted a linear regression analysis using the following model: 

GDP_per_capita = adjusted income growth + employment ratio + tax revenue

In the higher performing regions, income growth had a negative impact, with an increase in adjusted income growth was associated with a $814.83 decrease in GDP per capita. Employment ratio and tax revenue had a positive association, with a one unit increase leading to a $1160.32 and $859.32 increase in GDP per capita, respecitvely. All indicators were significant, with p-values less than 0.01 (@fig-regression_high). 

Examining the lower performing regions, our model focused on just the impact of tax revenue, as income growth and employment ratio were insignificant predictors at significance level = 0.05. Tax revenue demonstrated a positive impact on GDP per capita, with a one unit increase leading to $323.41 increase in GDP per capita. Tax revenue was the only significant indicator for these regions at significance level = 0.05, further highlighting the weaker associations observed amongst employment and income growth in the graphs(@fig-regression_low). 

Interestly enough, the model for lower-performing regions better explained the variability seen in GDP when compared to the higher-performing region, as seen by the higher adjusted R-squared of 0.33 (compared to that of higher regions = 0.214).
